# Chief Financial Officer Review

The following actions and tools can be implemented to help you save time, stay organized, and reduce overhead for your daily, weekly, and monthly tasks. 

## General Project Management
**Airtable** (https://www.airtable.com/) will be a valuable resource for your project management. You can get information out of your head and into a structured place. You can create tasks, projects, store documents, and organize your consultancy. You can also automate many actions out of airtable that will help you. Airtable has custom forms you can use to get information into a table. If you need to enter the same information often, make a form for it!

Examples: Use airtable information to create google docs. This works like a file merge in Word, where you can populate docs with Airtable data. You can create custom onboarding / policy / contracts / HR documents for new clients based on information and templates you have in airtable.

You can also schedule google calendar events automatically from airtable based on project deadlines, etc. This can keep you on track and make your tasks more visible.

## Meetings
Your meetings can be more efficient if you use an AI note taker. A good cross platform (zoom / google meet / in person) option is Otter. https://otter.ai/

You can have this tool summarize every meeting, highlight action items, and send transcripts to all participants. Combined with a meeting log in Airtable, this can be a full searchable history of all conversations on a project. 

## Templates
Your cash flow and budget templates require more manual work to update than you would prefer. Consider investing the time to build more generic templates with variable inputs that can be used for multiple projects. 

## Grant Work
We can build custom tools to match grant fund categories to Chart of accounts. These can be used to rapidly present clients with a guide for matching and spending funds. 

## Marketing / New Business
Using the book you have written, we can quickly put together an effective website that highlights your value. I have included a demo here.
